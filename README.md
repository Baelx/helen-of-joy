The image must be rendered at 1.538... times its width, which is set to the width of the window. Therefore, sh must equal 1.538... times sw.

It's got to be half of the canvas height + the distance from the top of the image to the top of the canvas.

canvas height = 800
image height = 2460

Halve them both and subtract the smaller from the larger

400
1230

((sw * 1.538)/2) - sh/2
