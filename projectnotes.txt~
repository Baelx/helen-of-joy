Links need to be in the same place relative to the image, not the canvas.
Link text and clickable area(triangles), will also need to shrink with proportionally with the image.


Measure the smallest possible window(a certain mobile device):

320 by 568 = 4:7

compared to a larger-size window:

1600 by 800 = 2:1

1600 / 320 = 5
Meaning smaller window is a 5th of the width of the larger

Determine image properties:

Image width = window width
Image height = window width * 1.538

the x coordinate of the items can remain the same, directly linked to the width of the canvas

The values you have set are for an 1600 width canvas

the y values are based on the height of the canvas, but they should match the image


261.46

800 / 170 = 4.70588
2460 / 170 = 14.47059
2460 / 261.46 = 9.4087
170 * 1.538 = 261.46


With your current setup, the x positions of your text are generally consistent across different resolutions, with all text elements drifting slightly to the right when viewed on smaller devices.
You need to re-think your y positions as these are generally out of whack
